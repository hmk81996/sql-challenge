# Task
I will be completing a research project about employees of a fictional company hired during the 1980s and 90s. Using six CSV files, I'll design corresponding tables, import those files into a SQL database and perform a series of queries on this new database. This task will require data modeling, data engineering and data analysis.

# Methodology 
## Data Modeling
Using the CSV files, I sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram in QuickDBD.

## Data Engineering
